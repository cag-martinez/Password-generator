# Password-generator

For this project i created a password generator where the user is asked how many characters he would like his password to be. The user can choose between 8 and 128 characters. If the user chooses a number less than or greater than that, they will be alerted and prompted to type another choice. Once they have chosen the length of their password, the user will be asked to confirm if they would like to use: lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters. The browser will then generate a password for the user at random.
